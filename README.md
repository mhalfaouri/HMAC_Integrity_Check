# HMAC_Integrity_Check
These scripts determine the integrity of a file utilizing HMAC

The hmac_python script that hashes a file using the HMAC algorithm and stores the hash value on a text file.  

The checkhash script then hashes the file and checks if the newly returned hash and the value stored on the text file are the same to determine the integrity of the file.
